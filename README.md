# data-visualization
Automated collection, analysis, and visualization of stock price data

The graphing_bollinger_bands script automatically pulls stock data from Yahoo Finance to create 
a graph displaying the stock price data and its bollinger bands (moving volatility based on moving 
mean and standard deviation) over n number of years. The user may specify the type (bollinger bands
or only stock price) and aesthetics of the graph (either beautifully clean with dashed lines, or 
more PowerPoint-professional style)
All axes labels and text positionings are dynamically determined

Finance professionals can use this script to quickly create beautiful bollinger band graphs to
assist with technical analysis, while business professionals can use the graph code
(e.g. clean_style) to automate the process of creating professional visuals for presentations
